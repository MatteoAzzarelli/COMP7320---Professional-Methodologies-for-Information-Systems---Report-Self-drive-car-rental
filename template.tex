% \begin{abstract}
%     In this report we are going to review the main concepts expressed by Mr. Edmon Chung in the talk held the day 29 January 2019.
%     The main point is the Global Internet Governance and some of the related concepts: like copyright, privacy, security and anonymity. Obviously these arguments involve also the policy of stats and we can see how some of them manage these arguments, with some restrictions, and in particular we could understand why privacy and security are in contradiction.

\section{Executive summary}
    In this document we have presented the detailed deliverables that describe the system development plan of our proposed system that is an information system that will provide its customers a platform to rent cars online seamlessly. This Self-drive car rental system is an initiative to tackle problems such as environment sustainability and faster renting of cars without the need of a middle-man or agency. The system we proposed can be used across multiple platforms such as mobile and website. In order to understand if the system implementation is justifiable we have done a thorough feasibility analysis to show the pros of accepting this system. Also, our system requirements focus on what functions the system should provide to both its users and admin and what requirements it should have in order to be successful. Through our system diagrams such as data flow diagrams and use case diagrams we represent the main functions of our systems such as car rental and registration in a visual way. We are highly hopeful that through the successful development and implementation of this system, the world will be a better place for you and us.

\section{Feasibility analysis}
    \subsection{Market Demand Analysis}
    
    In Hong Kong, although there is no need to pay customs duties when buying a car, the average number of car owners in the local area is much worse than other big cities.
    According to statistics, the number of people with a driver's license is close to 1.7 million, while the number of private cars is 600,000 , which means that 1.1 million people are “car-free”, and the market demand is considerable.
    
    Meanwhile, according to research, users are more inclined to travel 10-30 kilometres, which is one of the most important use scenarios for rental cars.
    Rental cars can meet the needs of car-free family short-distance travel privacy and flexibility, and are favoured by users.
    
    \subsection{Technical Analysis}
    
    In fact, the shared car system is essentially a platform for information docking.
    Users use this platform to query and use cars.
    Currently, many similar types of software use similar systems, such as OfO,Mobike,Airbnb, whose functional requirements are not complicated.
    
    However, this system still faces several challenges.
    First of all, in a place where the signal is not good, if the system is unable to connect to the network or malfunction when the user is driving the car, whether the system can continue to support the service shared by the car.
    Secondly, how to detect whether a car needs to be repaired is also a problem.
    Manual inspection and maintenance will increase costs.

    \subsection{Economic Analysis}
    
    Due to the heavy capital attribute of the automobile, the initial input cost of the industry is relatively high, so the intervention of capital is more needed, which increases the difficulty.
    
    In addition, the daily operating costs are also more complicated: parking space costs, fuelling costs, accident costs, vehicle maintenance and repair costs.
    Costs incurred by consumers themselves: violations, accidents, etc.
    
    Of course, these costs must theoretically be borne by consumers themselves, but this will greatly affect the consumer experience, so the operators must pay attention to the communication work here.
    
    \subsection{Operational Analysis}
    
    There are many links involved in the process of using sharing cars, such as: vehicle scheduling, parking management, fuelling management, insurance claims, road rescue, cleaning services, etc.
    Every links would impact the whole system operation seriously.
    
    \subsection{Legal and Contractual Analysis}
    
    There are three main legal and contractual risks related to the car-sharing systems.
    The first one is that there is no enough space for sharing-car parking.
    It would make user parking illegally if they could not find the suitable place.
    It would receive punishment from the relevant agencies.
    
    Meanwhile,the license resources for new vehicles are certain scarce resources, and Hong Kong also has quantitative control.
    So,license resources are considered as a very important constraint.
    
    Furthermore,in the process of using the vehicle, problems such as untimely handling of violations and influencing the use of internal health are often encountered, which increases the burden on vehicle management.

\section{Object Oriented (OO) Analysis and Design}
    \subsection{System description}
    
    \textbf{System overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This car-sharing system is suitable for everyone living in Hong Kong or visiting this region as a tourist. Because the main mission of it is to provide affordable car rental for them and make life easier for everyone.
        \item Self-drive car rental has three main subsystems, as finding a car, booking and returning it. All of these functionalities are obviously related to each other in order to provide very reliable and completely automated cross-platform mobile and web application.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \newpage
    \textbf{System functionality}\\
    As we mentioned before, there are three main functions of an application.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finding a car - a functionality used to locate the closest and available car to choose the most convenient and appropriate one.
        \item Booking a car - a functionality used to book a car for a certain time-slot in which it is going to be used by a client.
        \item Returning a car - a functionality used to return a car which was previously found and booked, in order to complete the whole process.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Components}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Online Web application will contain all the functionalities of the system. The users will be able to find, book and return a car using this platform. The only exception is that it will not be able to help the users to open/close a car.
        \item Mobile platforms for both Android and iOS will be mostly used to unlock the door of the booked car because you will need to scan the QR code on the machine to unlock it. It can be also used to other services as finding, booking and returning.
    \end{itemize}
